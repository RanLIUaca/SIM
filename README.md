# SIM
SIM is a probabilistic generative model for sequence interaction. It can be trained only by the paired binding sequences.

## Installation
You can install the released version of SIM from GitHub with:
1. Clone the GitHub repository and move to the SIM directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RanLIUaca/SIM
cd SIM/sim/sim
```

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment 
```bash
conda create sim_venv
conda activate sim_venv
conda install pip
```

3. Install the required packages 
```bash
pip install .
```

4. To test your installation, run the following command:
